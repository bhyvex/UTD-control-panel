Mailboxes and e-mail addresses



 An e-mail account on UTD-Hosting consists of two parts: a mailbox and one or
 more e-mail addresses that point to that mailbox. A mailbox is a container
 that stores your messages until your e-mail client downloads them (like a
 letter box holds letters until you fetch them). You can have one or more 
 e-mail addresses pointing to each mailbox, and any e-mail sent to these
 addresses is placed in the mailbox.


 For example, if you own the domain example.com, and want to set up
 e-mail accounts for two users, bob and alice, you would set up two mailboxes
 and two e-mail addresses. The mailboxes could be called bob@example.com
 and alice@example.com (although it's not really that important), and
 the e-mail addresses will be the same:



 Now suppose that bob also wants to receive e-mail sent to
 admin@example.com. You create another e-mail address, but map it to
 the same mailbox as his other e-mail address:



 Now when bob's e-mail client connects to his mailbox, he will receive mail
 sent to both e-mail addresses.
