Ticket reply time promise


 We aim to reply to all tickets within twenty four hours of them being
 opened. If you open a ticket and haven't received a response within
 seventy two hours, we'll automatically credit your account with a 
 month's free hosting to attempt to compensate you for the inconvenience
 caused.


 While we aim to answer all support requests as quickly as possible,
 we cannot guarentee that those submitted via e-mail or IRC will be
 dealt with within this timeframe. Where at all possible, support 
 requests should be made via the ticket system.
