Can I file support requests without using the control panel?


 You can file support requests by sending e-mail to
 support@utd-hosting.com. Note that when you submit support requests
 via e-mail, they are exempt from our reply time promise.
 Please make sure that you include your UTD-Hosting username with your query.
 For certain requests we may require that you log into the control panel to
 verify your identity.


 UTD-Hosting will never ask for your password by e-mail or any other method of
 communication.
