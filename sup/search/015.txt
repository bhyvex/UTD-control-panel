What does 'document root' mean?


 The document root of a site is the directory in which the site
 resides. When your account is created, your default site (with the domain
 name username.utd-hosting.com) has a document root of 
 /public_html. When you connect to your FTP account, you will see the
 public_html directory. Any files you upload to that directory will be visible
 via your website.


 When you add a new site, you need to put in a new document root. Generally,
 you will want to create a new directory for this site (using your FTP client),
 and set the document root to that directory.
