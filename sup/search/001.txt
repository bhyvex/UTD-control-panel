How do I configure PHP for my site?


 The UTD-Hosting control panel allows you to configure various PHP options
 for each of your sites. To do this, you must login to the UTD-Hosting control
 panel, and perform the following actions:
 

 Access the site overview page
 Click on the settings link next to the site you wish to edit
 Scroll down to the PHP Settings section


 Once you have finished changing the settings, click the save button
 at the bottom of the page. Please note that it may take up to five minutes for
 some changes to become active.
