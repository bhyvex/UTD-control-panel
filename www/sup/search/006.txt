Can I give other users access to the control panel?


 We currently have no plans to allow multiple users to manage a single site.
 You may give another person your login details so that they can manage your
 account, but this is strongly discouraged. UTD-Hosting cannot be held
 responsible for any action taken by any person to whom you gave your account
 details.


 Please also note that section 1.4 (Account ownership) of the Terms and
 Conditions forbits the resale of any UTD-Hosting service.
