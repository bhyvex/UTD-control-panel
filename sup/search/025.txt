Downtime promise


 While we'd all like to have 100% uptime, in practice this rarely happens.
 In order to compensate our customers for any downtime we experience, 
 UTD-Hosting will issue discount codes that extend the current billing cycle
 by twice the length of the downtime. So if we're down for an hour,
 you get two hours for free.


 After a period of downtime, an informational message will be posted by a 
 UTD-Hosting staff member, explaining the cause of the downtime, the recorded
 duration, and listing the discount code. This code will be valid for a week
 after the end of the downtime.
