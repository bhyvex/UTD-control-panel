Spam prevention


 All mail received by UTD-Hosting's mail servers is ran through several filters
 to help prevent spam. These filters should never affect any legitimate mail.


 The checks performed on incoming mail reject messages from servers that do not
 identify themselves correctly when connecting. This stops around 45% of all
 spam messages sent to UTD-Hosting's servers. All legimate e-mail servers will
 identify themselves properly (and are required to do so by the protocol
 specifications).


 The address of the remote server is then checked against four blacklists -
 sorbs, ordb, dsbl and spamhaus. These blacklists block known spammers and vulnerable machines
 which may be used to relay spam. Again, legitimate e-mail servers rearely find
 their way on to spam blacklists (and when they do, there's a simple de-listing
 process), so legitimate mail shouldn't be stopped.


 In a sample of mail received over twenty four hours, these processes stopped 86% of spam mail, with 0 false positives.
